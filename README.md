# Ori DE Mods

A collection of several mods that I haven't gotten around to putting in other repos.

## Accessibility Mod

Adds a few accessibility and QOL features such as pause menu improvements and map zoom level.

## Debug Enhanced

Adds more debug options and enables debug controls automatically.

## Map Trail

Adds a recent history of Ori's position to the map.

## Trainer

Fo far, just frame step.

## UI Speed Mod

Removes popups like Sein speech that get in the way if you've already read it a hundred times.
